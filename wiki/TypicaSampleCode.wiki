Here is some simple code that demonstrates using typica for SQS and EC2.

= Introduction =

This code can be found in Subverion, but it is sometimes helpful to document code sample in something approximating a users manual.

= SQS =
Usage of SQS is simple. First, you create or get an existing queue. For that, you have the QueueService object. When using a specific queue, the MessageQueue object provides methods for queue interaction.

= EC2 =
